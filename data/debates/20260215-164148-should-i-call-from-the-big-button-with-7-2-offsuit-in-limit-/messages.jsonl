Quantitatively, if your bluff frequency with 7-2 exceeds your pot odds-adjusted break-even rate, you lose value. So, disciplined folding combined with very occasional calls to keep opponents honest is the optimal long-term strategy here.","refusal":null,"annotations":[]},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":468,"completion_tokens":147,"total_tokens":615,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"accepted_prediction_tokens":0,"rejected_prediction_tokens":0}},"service_tier":"default","system_fingerprint":"fp_a391f2cee0"}}

They also concur that occasionally mixing in rare calls with 7-2 can add strategic ambiguity, preventing opponents from exploiting predictable folding patterns. The key point of divergence lies in emphasis: Big Tex stresses folding most of the time to preserve discipline, Avery highlights balancing frequency to keep opponents guessing, and Riley focuses on the risks of overusing such bluffs due to chip leakage. Next question: How should one optimally balance bluff frequency with 7-2 offsuit calls from the big button to maximize long-term value?\n\nRecent points from other personas:\nI agree with the consensus that 7-2 offsuit is garbage and folding is the default play. Avery’s point on balancing frequency is solid — throwing in a rare call here and there keeps your opponents honest. But like Riley said, overdoing it just leaks chips.
