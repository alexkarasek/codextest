Big Tex and Avery emphasize raising to leverage table dynamics and protect equity, while Riley stresses caution to avoid overcommitting chips and advocates a balanced post-flop approach based on board texture and opponent actions. The main disagreement lies in the degree of aggression post-flop and the risk tolerance when facing overcards.\n\nNext question: How should post-flop play with pocket jacks adjust depending on the number of opponents and board texture?\n\nRecent points from other personas:\nI’m with Big Tex and Avery on raising pre-flop with pocket jacks to isolate opponents and protect your equity. Post-flop play has to be dialed in based on both the board and how many players remain. Against fewer opponents, you can be more aggressive—bet to charge draws and weaker pairs.
