## Round 1

### Dr. Emily Carter

Excessive screen time poses measurable risks to children's cognitive, social, and emotional development, especially in early childhood when foundational neural circuits form. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and WHO recommend no screen exposure under 18 months, except video chatting, and limit 2- to 5-year-olds to one hour daily of high-quality programming. Prolonged screen use is linked to delayed language acquisition, reduced executive functioning, and impaired self-regulation (Hutton et al., 2019). However, well-curated, interactive media can support learning and social connection when balanced with active play and human interaction. Thus, I advocate structured, age-appropriate limits prioritizing developmental milestones—emphasizing that screen time should complement, not replace, hands-on experiences vital for healthy brain maturation.

### Alex Ramirez

I advocate for a nuanced, guided approach to screen time rather than rigid limits or unrestricted access. Emerging research, including from AAP, highlights developmental sensitivities, especially under age 5, but the digital landscape is rapidly evolving. Thoughtful curation—prioritizing high-quality, interactive content—combined with active parental scaffolding fosters critical thinking and creativity. Instead of fearing screens, we should empower children with digital literacy skills and balanced habits that prepare them for an increasingly tech-driven future. This includes co-viewing, discussing online content, integrating educational apps, and encouraging offline activities to maintain social-emotional development. Ultimately, screen time management must be flexible, context-aware, and equity-minded, supporting all children’s growth as confident, discerning digital citizens.

### Linda Thompson

As a parent who’s witnessed firsthand the emotional toll of unchecked screen time, I urgently call for strict, evidence-backed limits on children’s device use. My own son withdrew into hours of gaming, growing anxious and isolated, losing touch with friends and outdoor joys. Screens can hook kids like a drug, stunting crucial social skills and emotional resilience during sensitive developmental years. Real-world play and face-to-face interaction nurture empathy, confidence, and mental health in ways no screen can replicate. We owe it to our children to protect their well-being by enforcing firm boundaries and promoting outdoor, social activities—not caving to permissive or tech-optimistic views that ignore the concrete harms visible in countless families today. Our kids’ futures depend on it.

### Moderator Summary (Round 1)

All three agree that screen time impacts young people’s development and that quality content and parental involvement matter. Dr. Carter and Alex both cite research supporting early childhood screen limits but acknowledge some educational benefits with guided use. Alex emphasizes digital literacy and balanced habits, while Dr. Carter focuses on developmental risks and cautious exposure. Linda strongly advocates for strict limits, highlighting personal experience with negative emotional effects and social isolation. The main disagreement lies in the extent of restrictions versus a more flexible, guided approach.

Next question: How can parents and educators effectively balance screen time limits with fostering digital literacy and creativity in children?

## Round 2

### Dr. Emily Carter

I appreciate both perspectives emphasizing quality content and parental involvement. The AAP’s guidelines recommend no screen time under 18 months, except video calls, and limit to 1 hour daily of high-quality programming for ages 2 to 5, stressing co-viewing to scaffold learning and social interaction. This balances developmental risks—like impaired language acquisition and reduced executive function—with fostering digital literacy. For older children, setting consistent, reasonable limits supports self-regulation while encouraging creative, purposeful tech use (e.g., coding apps, digital storytelling). Strict bans risk alienation or secrecy, whereas guided exposure with clear boundaries nurtures healthy habits. Ultimately, parental modeling, active mediation, and prioritizing offline play remain critical to optimize cognitive and socioemotional development alongside digital engagement.

### Alex Ramirez

I fully agree that quality content and parental involvement are vital, and the AAP’s staged guidelines provide a helpful framework for young children. However, as kids grow, outright limits alone become less effective—digital literacy requires active guidance to navigate diverse online spaces safely and creatively. Parents and educators can scaffold this by co-engaging in digital activities—discussing content critically, encouraging creative projects like coding or digital storytelling, and setting collaborative screen time goals that include offline balance. This intentional approach nurtures critical thinking and resilience, equipping youth for an increasingly digital future. I also acknowledge concerns about emotional effects; thus, monitoring mood changes and fostering open dialogue remains essential alongside screen time management.

### Linda Thompson

I hear the calls for balanced digital literacy, but from my experience, without firm screen time limits, children quickly spiral into emotional distress and social withdrawal. My own child’s anxiety worsened during unmonitored screen use, isolating from family and friends. Yes, quality content and guidance matter, but they cannot substitute clear boundaries. Outdoor play and face-to-face interaction build empathy and resilience in ways screens never will. We have a moral duty to protect our kids from addiction and anxiety by enforcing strict, age-appropriate limits. Digital skills are important, but they must never come at the cost of our children’s emotional and social well-being. Let’s not gamble with their futures.

### Moderator Summary (Round 2)

All agree on the importance of quality content, parental involvement, and fostering digital literacy. Dr. Carter and Alex emphasize balanced, age-appropriate screen limits combined with guided, purposeful tech use to support development. Alex highlights co-engagement and collaborative goal-setting for older children. Linda stresses stricter limits to prevent emotional distress and social withdrawal, prioritizing offline interaction for empathy and resilience. The main disagreement lies in how firm screen time boundaries should be versus flexible, guided usage.

Next question: How can parents and educators best balance screen time limits with promoting digital literacy and emotional well-being in young people?

## Round 3

### Dr. Emily Carter

I appreciate the shared commitment to quality content and parental involvement. The AAP’s guidelines recommend under 2 years minimal screen time, then no more than 1 hour/day of high-quality programming for 2-5-year-olds, emphasizing co-viewing to support language and social-emotional development (Chassiakos et al., 2016). For school-age children, I concur with Alex that flexibility paired with active parental scaffolding fosters digital literacy—teaching critical thinking, online safety, and emotional regulation.

Linda’s concerns about emotional distress are valid, especially with excessive, unsupervised use linked to anxiety and social withdrawal (Twenge et al., 2018). However, rigid limits without engagement risk alienating youth or missing teachable moments. A balanced approach combines clear boundaries with ongoing dialogue and modeling healthy tech habits, promoting resilience and digital competence simultaneously.

### Alex Ramirez

I fully agree that quality content and parental involvement are foundational. The AAP’s age-based limits provide a useful baseline, particularly for young children’s brain development. However, rigid screen caps risk overlooking how guided, purposeful engagement can actively build critical thinking and creativity—skills essential for future digital fluency. Co-viewing and collaborative goal-setting, as Alex mentioned, scaffold children’s understanding and self-regulation, reducing risks of emotional distress more effectively than blunt limits alone. To balance well-being and literacy, I advocate for adaptive strategies: set clear boundaries aligned with developmental stages, but pair them with open dialogue about digital choices and media literacy education. This approach supports resilience and meaningful tech use rather than fear-driven restrictions.

### Linda Thompson

I deeply respect the value of quality content and parental involvement, but from my experience as a parent, flexible limits often slip into endless screen use that isolates kids emotionally. I’ve seen firsthand how my son’s anxiety grew when screen time crept beyond recommended limits—he withdrew from family and outdoor play. The AAP’s clear boundaries exist to protect children’s fragile emotional and social development, not to stifle creativity. Strict, enforceable limits paired with promoting real-world connection and outdoor play are non-negotiable. Digital literacy is vital, yes, but teaching it cannot come at the cost of a child’s empathy, resilience, or mental health. We have a moral duty to prioritize their whole well-being over tech convenience.

### Moderator Summary (Round 3)

All agree on the importance of quality content and parental involvement. Dr. Carter and Alex emphasize flexibility with guided, purposeful screen use to build digital literacy and emotional regulation, aligning with AAP guidelines. Linda stresses the emotional risks of excessive, unregulated screen time, advocating for strict, enforceable limits to prevent isolation and anxiety. The main disagreement lies in how rigid screen time boundaries should be versus flexible, scaffolded approaches.

Next question: How can parents effectively balance screen time limits with fostering digital literacy and emotional well-being in young people?
