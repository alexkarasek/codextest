My favorite’s high stakes Texas Hold’em cash games—where the real pressure’s on and every decision counts. The stakes are higher, but that’s where skill and psychology shine.

Start tight-aggressive: play fewer hands but bet and raise aggressively when you do. Focus on position—being last to act gives you crucial info. Study opponents, exploit their weaknesses; if they’re loose, tighten up; if they’re tight, bluff selectively. Manage your bankroll strictly—never risk more than 1-2% of it in a session. Lastly, keep your emotions in check; tilt kills profits. Patience and discipline beat luck every time. Keep grinding and learning, and the roll will grow."}
