It’s a card game where players bet based on the strength of their hands, aiming to win chips or money. The most common version is Texas Hold’em, where each player gets two private cards and shares five community cards to make the best five-card hand. Understanding hand rankings and betting strategies is key. Want me to explain the rules or give tips?"}

Play tight early—stick to strong starting hands to avoid costly mistakes. Use bluffing sparingly and contextually; it’s about convincing opponents you have a stronger hand. For example, if you’ve been passive, a well-timed bluff can be more believable. Lastly, pay attention to opponents’ betting patterns to read their strength. This disciplined approach balances risk and reward efficiently."}
